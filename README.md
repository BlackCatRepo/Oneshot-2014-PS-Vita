# Oneshot (2014) "port" for PS VITA

**This game contains full version of Oneshot from 2014, please be sure to check this guy: https://foxfan-e.itch.io/newko-mod and this guy: https://github.com/cmaster25. They make this game possible run on Android or Wii with new Niko sprites. So I decided to try this one on Vita and it's worked! You can find this version with old sprites on itch.io**

## Technical notes

This game runs slow, sound little bit glitchy when you see FPS drops and other FPS issues.


## Functionality 

This game runs and I guess you can complete it without broken stuff (in general I don't know about full functionality). Don't know about saves.


## Known problems 

Initial release comes up with some known issues:

- Game is slow. I mean that this version have huge problems with FPS.

- CROSS = Confirm
- CIRCLE = Cancel/Inventory
